# Stardalization-from-scratch

This is an example of how to perform a standardization without performing very complex procedures.

## What is?

This code was based on the step-by-step instructions presented in this video:

## Libraries

These codes were tested using these libraries: 

| Package | Version |
|:-------:|:-------:|
| numpy   | 1.20.1  |

## Code

The code is in file [standardization.py](standardization.py)

A "python notebook" was created to be more didactic, [standardization-from-scratch.ipynb](standardization-from-scratch.ipynb)

## Contributions

It's always good to improve this algorithm to be faster, lighter and more didactic. Feel free to contribute to this repository.
